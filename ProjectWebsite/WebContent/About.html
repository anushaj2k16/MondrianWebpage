<p>The query Q1 asks for all fields of all records in a relation
R whose field pk equals a certain constant value c. Assuming
the attribute pk is a (non-compound) primary key, the database
system can efficiently identify exactly one record without
scanning the entire relation. Once the record is found, all fields
are materialized for the result. This extreme case is an example
of a record-centric data access pattern. NSM combined with
the Volcano-style processing model suits well for this access
pattern in case the costs for function calls can be hidden by
data access costs. More specifically, NSM works well for diskbased
systems, but has limited CPU data cache efficiency for
main-memory systems [28], [29].
In contrast, DSM is utilized for database systems which are
issued with an attribute-centric data access pattern: operations
access a large subset of relation’s records, and a small to tiny
subset of fields per record. For a b</p>

Employing special-purpose processors (e.g., GPUs)
in database systems has been studied throughout the last decade.
Research on heterogeneous database systems that use both
general- and special-purpose processors has addressed either
transaction- or analytic processing, but not the combination of
them. Support for hybrid transaction- and analytic processing
(HTAP) has been studied exclusively for CPU-only systems. In
this paper we ask the question whether current systems are
ready for HTAP workload management with cooperating generaland
special-purpose processors. For this, we take the perspective
of the backbone of database systems: the storage engine. We
propose a unified terminology and a comprehensive taxonomy to
compare state-of-the-art engines from both domains. We show
similarities and differences, and determine a necessary set of
features for engines supporting HTAP workload on CPUs and
GPUs.
